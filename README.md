# Async-JS

This is an inhacement of my javascript project where I created School Management System.
Recently, after learning and practising Async JavaScript concepts like, Fetch API and async-await, I refactored code and added UI. I turned some methods into Http requests and handled responses and errors - for this I utilized JSON-server.
I'm still working on the design and plan to incoporate Firestore Database and Firestone Hosting in the project.
